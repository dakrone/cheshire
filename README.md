'Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at all know
whether it would like the name: however, it only grinned a little
wider.  'Come, it's pleased so far,' thought Alice, and she went
on. 'Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?'

'That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said the Cat.

'I don't much care where--' said Alice.

'Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.

'--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.

'Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, 'if you only walk long
enough.'

Cheshire is fast JSON encoding, based off of clj-json and
clojure-json, with additional features like Date/UUID/Set/Symbol
encoding and SMILE support.

[Clojure code with docs](http://dakrone.github.com/cheshire/)

[![Continuous Integration status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dakrone/cheshire.png)](http://travis-ci.org/dakrone/cheshire)

## Why?

clojure-json had really nice features (custom encoders), but was slow;
clj-json had no features, but was fast. Cheshire encodes JSON fast,
with added support for more types and the ability to use custom
encoders.

## Usage

```clojure
[cheshire "5.8.1"]

;; Cheshire v5.8.1 uses Jackson 2.9.6

;; In your ns statement:
(ns my.ns
  (:require [cheshire.core :refer :all]))
```

### Encoding

```clojure
;; generate some json
(generate-string {:foo "bar" :baz 5})

;; write some json to a stream
(generate-stream {:foo "bar" :baz 5} (clojure.java.io/writer "/tmp/foo"))

;; generate some SMILE
(generate-smile {:foo "bar" :baz 5})

;; generate some JSON with Dates
;; the Date will be encoded as a string using
;; the default date format: yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'
(generate-string {:foo "bar" :baz (java.util.Date. 0)})

;; generate some JSON with Dates with custom Date encoding
(generate-string {:baz (java.util.Date. 0)} {:date-format "yyyy-MM-dd"})

;; generate some JSON with pretty formatting
(generate-string {:foo "bar" :baz {:eggplant [1 2 3]}} {:pretty true})
;; {
;;   "foo" : "bar",
;;   "baz" : {
;;     "eggplant" : [ 1, 2, 3 ]
;;   }
;; }

;; generate JSON escaping UTF-8
(generate-string {:foo "It costs Â£100"} {:escape-non-ascii true})
;; => "{\"foo\":\"It costs \\u00A3100\"}"

;; generate JSON and munge keys with a custom function
(generate-string {:foo "bar"} {:key-fn (fn [k] (.toUpperCase (name k)))})
;; => "{\"FOO\":\"bar\"}"
```

In the event encoding fails, Cheshire will throw a JsonGenerationException.

#### Custom Pretty Printing Options

If Jackson's default pretty printing library is not what you desire, you can
manually create your own pretty printing class and pass to the `generate-string`
or `encode` methods:

```clojure
(let [my-pretty-printer (create-pretty-printer
                          (assoc default-pretty-print-options
                                 :indent-arrays? true))]
  (generate-string {:foo [1 2 3]} {:pretty my-pretty-printer}))
```

See the `default-pretty-print-options` for a list of options that can be
changed.

### Decoding

```clojure
;; parse some json
(parse-string "{\"foo\":\"bar\"}")
;; => {"foo" "bar"}

;; parse some json and get keywords back
(parse-string "{\"foo\":\"bar\"}" true)
;; => {:foo "bar"}

;; parse some json and munge keywords with a custom function
(parse-string "{\"foo\":\"bar\"}" (fn [k] (keyword (.toUpperCase k))))
;; => {:FOO "bar"}

;; top-level strings are valid JSON too
(parse-string "\"foo\"")
;; => "foo"

;; parse some SMILE (keywords option also supported)
(parse-smile <your-byte-array>)

;; parse a stream (keywords option also supported)
(parse-stream (clojure.java.io/reader "/tmp/foo"))

;; parse a stream lazily (keywords option also supported)
(parsed-seq (clojure.java.io/reader "/tmp/foo"))

;; parse a SMILE stream lazily (keywords option also supported)
(parsed-smile-seq (clojure.java.io/reader "/tmp/foo"))

;; parse a nested part of the stream lazily (keywords option also supported)
(parse-stream (clojure.java.io/reader "/tmp/foo") nil nil [#{"foo"} #{"bar"}] true)
```

In 2.0.4 and up, Cheshire allows passing in a
function to specify what kind of types to return, like so:

```clojure
;; In this example a function that checks for a certain key
(decode "{\"myarray\":[2,3,3,2],\"myset\":[1,2,2,1]}" true
        (fn [field-name]
          (if (= field-name "myset")
            #{}
            [])))
;; => {:myarray [2 3 3 2], :myset #{1 2}}
```
The type must be "transient-able", so use either #{} or []


### Custom Encoders

Custom encoding is supported from 2.0.0 and up, if you encounter a
bug, please open a github issue. From 5.0.0 onwards, custom encoding
has been moved to be part of the core namespace (not requiring a
namespace change)

```clojure
;; Custom encoders allow you to swap out the api for the fast
;; encoder with one that is slightly slower, but allows custom
;; things to be encoded:
(ns myns
  (:require [cheshire.core :refer :all]
            [cheshire.generate :refer [add-encoder encode-str remove-encoder]]))

;; First, add a custom encoder for a class:
(add-encoder java.awt.Color
             (fn [c jsonGenerator]
               (.writeString jsonGenerator (str c))))

;; There are also helpers for common encoding actions:
(add-encoder java.net.URL encode-str)

;; List of common encoders that can be used: (see generate.clj)
;; encode-nil
;; encode-number
;; encode-seq
;; encode-date
;; encode-bool
;; encode-named
;; encode-map
;; encode-symbol
;; encode-ratio

;; Then you can use encode from the custom namespace as normal
(encode (java.awt.Color. 1 2 3))
;; => "java.awt.Color[r=1,g=2,b=3]"

;; Custom encoders can also be removed:
(remove-encoder java.awt.Color)

;; Decoding remains the same, you are responsible for doing custom decoding.
```

<h3>NOTE: `cheshire.custom` has been deprecated in version 5.0.0</h3>

Custom and Core encoding have been combined in Cheshire 5.0.0, so
there is no longer any need to require a different namespace depending
on what you would like to use.

### Aliases

There are also a few aliases for commonly used functions:

    encode -> generate-string
    encode-stream -> generate-stream
    encode-smile -> generate-smile
    decode -> parse-string
    decode-stream -> parse-stream
    decode-smile -> parse-smile

## Features
Cheshire supports encoding standard clojure datastructures, with a few
additions.

Cheshire encoding supports:

### Clojure data structures
- strings
- lists
- vectors
- sets
- maps
- symbols
- booleans
- keywords (qualified and unqualified)
- numbers (Integer, Long, BigInteger, BigInt, Double, Float, Ratio,
  Short, Byte, primitives)
- clojure.lang.PersistentQueue

### Java classes
- Date
- UUID
- java.sql.Timestamp
- any java.util.Set
- any java.util.Map
- any java.util.List

### Custom class encoding while still being fast

### Also supports
- Stream encoding/decoding
- Lazy decoding
- Pretty-printing JSON generation
- Unicode escaping
- Custom keyword coercion
- Arbitrary precision for decoded values:

Cheshire will automatically use a BigInteger if needed for
non-floating-point numbers, however, for floating-point numbers,
Doubles will be used unless the `*use-bigdecimals?*` symbol is bound
to true:

```clojure
(ns foo.bar
  (require [cheshire.core :as json]
           [cheshire.parse :as parse]))

(json/decode "111111111111111111111111111111111.111111111111111111111111111111111111")
;; => 1.1111111111111112E32 (a Double)

(binding [parse/*use-bigdecimals?* true]
  (json/decode "111111111111111111111111111111111.111111111111111111111111111111111111"))
;; => 111111111111111111111111111111111.111111111111111111111111111111111111M (a BigDecimal)
```

## Change Log

[Change log](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire/blob/master/ChangeLog.md) is available on GitHub.

## Speed

Cheshire is about twice as fast as data.json.

Check out the benchmarks in `cheshire.test.benchmark`; or run `lein
benchmark`. If you have scenarios where Cheshire is not performing as
well as expected (compared to a different library), please let me
know.

## Experimental things

In the `cheshire.experimental` namespace:

```
$ echo "Hi. \"THIS\" is a string.\\yep." > /tmp/foo

$ lein repl
user> (use 'cheshire.experimental)
nil
user> (use 'clojure.java.io)
nil
user> (println (slurp (encode-large-field-in-map {:id "10"
                                                  :things [1 2 3]
                                                  :body "I'll be removed"}
                                                 :body
                                                 (input-stream (file "/tmp/foo")))))
{"things":[1,2,3],"id":"10","body":"Hi. \"THIS\" is a string.\\yep.\n"}
nil
```

`encode-large-field-in-map` is used for streamy JSON encoding where
you want to JSON encode a map, but don't want the map in memory all at
once (it returns a stream). Check out the docstring for full usage.

It's experimental, like the name says. Based on [Tigris](http://github.com/dakrone/tigris).

## Advanced customization for factories
See
[this](http://fasterxml.github.com/jackson-core/javadoc/2.1.1/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonFactory.Feature.html)
and
[this](http://fasterxml.github.com/jackson-core/javadoc/2.1.1/com/fasterxml/jackson/core/JsonParser.Feature.html)
for a list of features that can be customized if desired. A custom
factory can be used like so:

```clojure
(ns myns
  (:require [cheshire.core :as core]
            [cheshire.factory :as factory]))

(binding [factory/*json-factory* (factory/make-json-factory
                                  {:allow-non-numeric-numbers true})]
  (json/decode "{\"foo\":NaN}" true))))))
```

See the `default-factory-options` map in
[factory.clj](https://github.com/dakrone/cheshire/blob/master/src/cheshire/factory.clj)
for a full list of configurable options. Smile factories can also be
created, and factories work exactly the same with custom encoding.

## Future Ideas/TODOs
- <del>move away from using Java entirely, use Protocols for the
  custom encoder</del> (see custom.clj)
- <del>allow custom encoders</del> (see custom.clj)
- <del>figure out a way to encode namespace-qualified keywords</del>
- <del>look into overriding the default encoding handlers with custom handlers</del>
- <del>better handling when java numbers overflow ECMAScript's numbers
  (-2^31 to (2^31 - 1))</del>
- <del>handle encoding java.sql.Timestamp the same as
  java.util.Date</del>
- <del>add benchmarking</del>
- get criterium benchmarking ignored for 1.2.1 profile
- <del> look into faster exception handling by pre-allocating an exception
  object instead of creating one on-the-fly (maybe ask Steve?)</del>
- make it as fast as possible (ongoing)
